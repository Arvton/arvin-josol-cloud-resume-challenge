# Cloud Resume Challenge — Arvin Josol

This is the project repository for my Cloud Resume Challenge.  I am going through the challenge to make further use of my knowledge and skills from the cloud certifications I have earned. 

Through my workplace, I get to build my experience with cloud solutions professionally. I want to further boost my skills by making my own cloud-based projects.  

# Challenge Homepage

The creator’s homepage for the challenge is here: [The Cloud Resume Challenge](https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/)

From the challenge FAQ:

“The Cloud Resume Challenge is a hands-on project designed to help you bridge the gap from cloud **certification** to cloud **job**. It incorporates many of the skills that real cloud and DevOps engineers use in their daily work.”

# Project Details

The challenge is broken down into 16 different steps. I will fill out each section as I work through the challenge.

## 1. Certification

I have seven different Azure certifications. My most advanced certifications, as of Feb 2024, would be the AZ-400 and AZ-104. I am currently preparing for the AZ-305 exam.

## 2. HTML

This step involves converting my one-page resume into HTML elements.  It is closely tied to step 3 since I’m planning to make the website design responsive for mobile and tablet.

Turning a two-column, 8.5 x 11 paper, into something that would look good for mobile took longer than expected. 

## 3. CSS

I’m using Sass to create my CSS stylesheets for the challenge. For the layout, Flexbos will be used where needed.

This isn’t normally part of the challenge but I want to incorporate what I know from my coding bootcamp experience.

## 4. Static Website

The website is hosted as a static website on an Azure storage account. Simpler hosting solutions like Netlify and Azure Static Web Apps were avoided to increase the learning opportunity.

## 5. HTTPS + CDN

The challenge website uses Microsoft CDN (classic). I created a CDN profile and endpoint.  The CDN endpoint uses a custom domain, TLS, a CDN managed certificate, and a rule to redirect HTTP request to HTTPS.

## 6. DNS

I added a CNAME record for the CDN endpoint on DigitalOcean where I manage my DNS records.

## 7. JavaScript

## 8. Database

## 9. API

## 10. Python

## 11. Tests

## 12. Infrastructure as Code

## 13. Source Control

## 14. CI/CD (Back end)

## 15. CI/CD (Front end)

## 16. Blog post

# Extending the Project

I’ll be extending the project with more features that align with the cloud certifications that I have earned.
